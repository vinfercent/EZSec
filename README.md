# EZSec
Brandon Horton and Gabriel Ferrer's RowdyHacks 2023 Project.

Purpose: Assisting the elderly and individuals who are not tech-savvy. Provides an extra layer of security to their Chrome browser by enabling a few security features, that are otherwise turned off (by default), all conveniently at the click of one button.

FOR TESTING AND PERSONAL USE: Be sure to install ALL of the files, including images, and place them in one folder. For testing, upload the folder to chrome://extensions and be sure to enable developer console!
